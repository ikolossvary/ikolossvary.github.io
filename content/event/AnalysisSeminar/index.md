The seminar runs Thursdays from 12:15 to 13:15.
Schedule for Fall of 2024:

- **September 19: Antti Käenmäki (Rényi)**   
Title: *Do self-conformal measures on the real line resonate?*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
In the 60's, Furstenberg conjectured that if $X,Y \subset [0,1]$ are closed sets invariant under multiplication by integers $p$ and $q \mod 1$, respectively, then for any $s \ne 0$, the resonance inequality
  $\dim_H(X+sY) < \min{ 1,\dim_H(X) + \dim_H(Y) }$
implies that $\log(p)/\log(q)$ is a rational number. Intuitively, if $\log(p)/\log(q)$ is irrational, then $X$ and $Y$ dissonate by which we mean that the expansions of $X$ and $Y$ in bases $p$ and $q$, respectively, have no common structure. A similar question can be asked for convolutions of two measures. In this talk, which is based on a recent work with B. Bárány, A. Pyörälä, and M. Wu, we answer whether two self-conformal measures in the real line resonate or dissonate.

Title: *Trace inequality with Bessel convolution*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Considering potentials defined by the Bessel kernel with Bessel convolution, a Kerman-Sawyer type characterization of the trace inequality is given. As an application, an estimate on the least eigenvalue of Schrödinger-Bessel operators is derived.

- **October 3: Patrícia Szokol (Debrecen)**   
Title: *Characterization of quasi-arithmetic means without regularity condition*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
We focus on the characterization theorem of János Aczél (1948) on quasi-arithmetic means. He proved that every continuous, bisymmetric, symmetric, reflexive, strictly monotonic binary map on a proper interval is a quasi-arithmetic mean.
Our first goal is to show a somewhat surprising result, namely, the purely algebraic bisymmetry property has a regularity improving feature. More precisely, our first theorem shows that the continuity property in the original theorem is redundant. 
As a continuation of this result, we demonstrate that it can be refined in the way that the symmetry condition can be weakened by assuming symmetry only for a pair of distinct points of an interval.
The presentation is based on joint papers with Pál Burai and Gergely Kiss.

- **October 10: Michał Rams (IMPAN)**   
Title: *Projections of fractal percolations*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Fractal percolations, introduced by Mandelbrot in relation to turbulent flows, are a very nice and natural random fractal constructions. They play in particular an important role in statistical physics, serving as one of only two easy-to-investigate model of phase transitions (the other one being the Ising model of ferromagnetic in dimension 2).
In the talk I will present results, joint with prof. Simon Karoly from BME, about projections of percolations. In particular, we will be interested in the question whether the projection of a percolation contains an interval. I plan to present the full proof of the simplest case, together with a short tour about the directions this result was generalized later.
