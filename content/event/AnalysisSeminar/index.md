Schedule for Fall of 2024:

- **September 19: Antti Käenmäki**   
Title: *Do self-conformal measures on the real line resonate?*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
In the 60's, Furstenberg conjectured that if $X,Y \subset [0,1]$ are closed sets invariant under multiplication by integers $p$ and $q \mod 1$, respectively, then for any $s \ne 0$, the resonance inequality
  $\dim_H(X+sY) < \min{ 1,\dim_H(X) + \dim_H(Y) }$
implies that $\log(p)/\log(q)$ is a rational number. Intuitively, if $\log(p)/\log(q)$ is irrational, then $X$ and $Y$ dissonate by which we mean that the expansions of $X$ and $Y$ in bases $p$ and $q$, respectively, have no common structure. A similar question can be asked for convolutions of two measures. In this talk, which is based on a recent work with B. Bárány, A. Pyörälä, and M. Wu, we answer whether two self-conformal measures in the real line resonate or dissonate.
