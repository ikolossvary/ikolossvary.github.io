Schedule for Fall of 2024:

- **September 19: Antti Käenmäki**   
Title: *Do self-conformal measures on the real line resonate?*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
In the 60's, Furstenberg conjectured that if $X,Y \subset [0,1]$ are closed sets invariant under multiplication by integers $p$ and $q \mod 1$, respectively, then for any $s \ne 0$, the resonance inequality
  $\dim_H(X+sY) < \min{ 1,\dim_H(X) + \dim_H(Y) }$
implies that $\log(p)/\log(q)$ is a rational number. Intuitively, if $\log(p)/\log(q)$ is irrational, then $X$ and $Y$ dissonate by which we mean that the expansions of $X$ and $Y$ in bases $p$ and $q$, respectively, have no common structure. A similar question can be asked for convolutions of two measures. In this talk, which is based on a recent work with B. Bárány, A. Pyörälä, and M. Wu, we answer whether two self-conformal measures in the real line resonate or dissonate.

- **11:00-11:45 Sascha Troscheit**   
Title: *Continuum trees of real functions and their graphs*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
The Brownian continuum tree (CRT) is an important random metric space that was extensively investigated in the 1990s. It can be constructed by a change of metric from a Brownian excursion function on $[0,1]$. This change of metric can be applied to all continuous circle mappings to give a continuum tree associated with the function.   
In 2008, Picard proved that analytic properties of the function are connected to the dimension theory of its tree: the upper box dimension of the continuum tree coincides with the variation index of the contour function. We will provide a short and direct proof of Picard's theorem through the study of packings. The methods used will inspire different notions of variations and variation indices, and we will link the dimension theory of the tree with the dimension theory of the graph of its contour function.

- **12:15-13:00 Michal Rams**   
Title: *Lyapunov spectrum of matrix cocycles*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
I will give an introduction into calculation of the Lyapunov spectrum of $SL(2,R)$ matrix cocycles, presenting results we got with Lorenzo Diaz and Katrin Gelfert.
